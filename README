gevent-zeromq
=============

Wrapper of pyzmq to make it compatible with gevent.

Inspired by Ben Ford's work on zmq support in eventlet.

Requires pyzmq>=2.1.0

Will build with cython if available. In my simple nonscientific test this
resulted in an almost 50% speedup in a local 1-1 PUB SUB sending of 100,000
1K messages.

Usage:

Instead of importing zmq directly do a:

..
    
    from gevent_zeromq import zmq

And use as normal.

This compatibility is accomplished by ensuring the nonblocking flag is set
before any blocking operation and the file descriptor for is handed to gevent.
